## TDD - Test Driven Development
### Why should we use TDD and benefits?
- Acceptance Criteria -  Use acceptance criteria as a means to know what you need to test and then,
  once you've got that list in the form of test code, you can rest safely in the knowledge that you haven't missed any work.
  
- Fewer Bugs - If a bug does come up, you can write a test first before attempting to fix the problem, to ensure that the bug won't come up again. This also helps define what the bug actually is, as you always need reproducible steps.  


**Best Use Cases**
- We will use Pytest unittest in Python to implement TDD

```python
def greeting(name):
    return "Hello" + name

def thanks(name):
    return "Thank you for visiting " +name
```

- TDD is widely used and is the cheapest way to test the code or implement test driven development

**Best practices for TDD**
- Write the smallest possible test case that matches what we need programs
- TDD Cycle start with everything failing `RED`
- Write code to pass the test `GREEN`
- Refactor the code for next test `BLUE`
- This continues until all test have successfully passed

- lets create a file called
`test_unittes_samplecalc.py`
  - Naming convention is extremely important when it comes to TDD

|assertIsInstance(a, b)   |    isinstance(a, b)    |3.2|
|assertNotIsInstance(a, b)|    not isinstance(a, b)|3.2| 



```python
# Let's create test to check if the code whould be running without any errors

from simple_calc import SimpleCalc
# importing the file and class where we would write our code

# importing unittest to inherit TestCase to create our tests against the code
import unittest


class CalcTest(unittest.TestCase):
    calc = SimpleCalc()  # creating an object of our SimpleCalc() class

    def test_add(self):  # naming convention - using test in the name of our
        # function will let python interpreter know that this needs to be tested
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(2, 4), 6)
        # this test is checking if 2 + 2 = 6 that would be true, if true test will pass

    def test_subtract(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.subtract(4, 2), 2)
        # This tests the values as 4 - 2 = 2 to be True, if True the test passes

    def test_multiply(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.multiply(2, 2), 4)
        # This tests the values as 2 * 2 = 4 to be True

    def test_divide(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.divide(15, 3), 5)
        # This tests the values as 15 / 3 = 5 if True the test will pass

```

- Run code with `python -m pytest`
**Let's write our code now to pass the tests**
  

```python
class SimpleCalc:
    # pass

    def add(self, value1, value2):
        return value1 + value2
        # this function adds the values for value1 and value2 against we test we have in other class

    def subtract(self, value1, value2):
        return value1 - value2

    def multiply(self, value1, value2):
        return value1 * value2

    def divide(self, value1, value2):
        return value1 / value2
```


- Running the test with `python -m unittest discover -v`
```
python -m unittest discover -v
test_add (test_unittest_simplecalc.CalcTest) ... ok
test_divide (test_unittest_simplecalc.CalcTest) ... ok
test_multiply (test_unittest_simplecalc.CalcTest) ... ok
test_subtract (test_unittest_simplecalc.CalcTest) ... ok

Ran 4 tests in 0.001s

- Summary

- TDD helps reduce the unexpected errors
