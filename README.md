# TDD - Test Driven Development
## Why should we use TDD?
## What are benefits?
**Best Use Cases**
- We will use Pytest unittest in Python to implement TDD


```python
def greeting(name):
    return "Hello" + name

def thanks(name):
    return "Thank you for visiting " +name
```

- TDD is widely used and is the cheapest way to test the code or implement test driven development

**Best practices for TDD**
- Write the smallest possible test case that matches what we need programs
- TDD Cycle start with everything failing `RED`
- Write code to pass the test `GREEN`
- Refactor the code for next test `BLUE`
- This continues until all test have successfully passed

- lets create a file called
`test_unittes_samplecalc.py`
  - Naming convention is extremely important when it comes to TDD

|assertTrue(x)            |    bool(x) is True     ||  
|assertFalse(x)           |    bool(x) is False    ||  
|assertIs(a, b)           |    a is b             |3.1|
|assertIsNot(a, b)        |    a is not b          |3.1|
|assertIsNone(x)          |    x is None           |3.1|
|assertIsNotNone(x)       |    x is not None       |3.1|
|assertIn(a, b)           |    a in b              |3.1|
|assertNotIn(a, b)        |    a not in b         |3.1|
|assertIsInstance(a, b)   |    isinstance(a, b)    |3.2|
|assertNotIsInstance(a, b)|    not isinstance(a, b)|3.2| 



```python
# Let's create test to check if the code whould be running without any errors

from simple_calc import SimpleCalc
# importing the file and class where we would write our code

# importing unittest to inherit TestCase to create our tests against the code
import unittest


class CalcTest(unittest.TestCase):
    calc = SimpleCalc()  # creating an object of our SimpleCalc() class

    def test_add(self):  # naming convention - using test in the name of our
        # function will let python interpreter know that this needs to be tested
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.add(2, 4), 6)
        # this test is checking if 2 + 2 = 6 that would be true, if true test will pass

    def test_subtract(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.subtract(4, 2), 2)
        # This tests the values as 4 - 2 = 2 to be True, if True the test passes

    def test_multiply(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.multiply(2, 2), 4)
        # This tests the values as 2 * 2 = 4 to be True

    def test_divide(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.calc.divide(15, 3), 5)
        # This tests the values as 15 / 3 = 5 if True the test will pass

```

- Run code with `python -m pytest`
**Let's write our code now to pass the tests**
  

```python
class SimpleCalc:
    # pass

    def add(self, value1, value2):
        return value1 + value2
        # this function adds the values for value1 and value2 against we test we have in other class

    def subtract(self, value1, value2):
        return value1 - value2

    def multiply(self, value1, value2):
        return value1 * value2

    def divide(self, value1, value2):
        return value1 / value2
```
